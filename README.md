# SuperGroovyPong

Antonio Croissy | Marco Puig | Hana Segura | Laura Waldron

A fast-paced Pong game implemented in Java using the LibGDX library. The game offers a classic Pong experience with a twist of increased speed and challenging gameplay. We will incorporate free movement until a certain point. The ball speed increases as the player keeps hitting the ball, going from a cold color to a warmer color. We have one player mode, with a basic AI as the opponent, and the players navigate with the wasd or arrow keys. We are also including sound effects, and possibly a leaderboard. We will have screens for instructions and also when the game ends. Players are able to restart the game, or to pause/resume in the middle of the game. Overall, this will be an engaging pong game where players test their skills.
